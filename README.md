# js30
My repo for Javascript30 course

[JavaScript30(https://javascript30.com) is a series of videos to learn vanilla JS (ES6). The course teaches through projects (i.e. you're not just building another to-do app), and assumes some familiarity with JavaScript.

My repository is the code I write/follow. Each folder will have a README.md, which is a recap of the things learned in the lesson. I'm typing this out here so I actually do it...
